# LibraryManagmentSystem

It is a simple library system. It has the functions of adding new books, increasing the number of existing books, borrowing books, searching for books, showing all books, showing all borrowed books, and showing overdue books.
Additionally, the user can log in as a member or guest. However, guest users cannot perform some functions.
Guest users can add books to the library, but they cannot borrow books. Since they cannot borrow books, they cannot return books. Apart from that, they can do anything that registered users can do.
